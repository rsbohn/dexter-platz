# Navigation Control Updates

## Context
Updated camera navigation controls based on issue requirements to use Q/E for camera rotation and A/D for lateral movement.

## Actions taken
- Changed camera rotation controls from A/D to Q/E keys
- Kept W/S for forward/back movement unchanged  
- Implemented lateral (strafe) movement using A/D keys
- Added calculation of right vector for lateral movement
- Updated README.md to document new key bindings

## Decisions
- Maintained existing W/S forward/back movement to avoid breaking existing muscle memory
- Used A=strafe left, D=strafe right for intuitive lateral movement
- Q=rotate left, E=rotate right maintains logical left/right mapping

## Commands
```bash
cargo check  # Verified compilation
```

## Next steps
- Test the actual movement and rotation in the running application
- Verify controls feel natural and responsive
