# platz

A minimal Bevy voxel mini-game scaffold.

## Run

Ensure Rust and Cargo are installed, then:

```
cargo run
```
This launches a Bevy window rendering a 9×9×9 chunk world
with a simple ground layer and basic lighting.

## Build

```
cargo build --release
```

## Next steps
- Decide if this should be a binary, a library, or a workspace.
- Add dependencies in `Cargo.toml`.
- Add CI (fmt, clippy, tests) if needed.
- Choose a license.
